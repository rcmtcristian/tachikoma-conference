#Info 
I delved into the world of anime and Ghost in the Shell, particularly centering around the charming robot Tachikoma. These animated companions hold a special place in my heart. I can vividly recall the hours spent immersed in their adventures, and now, I yearn to capture that sense of nostalgia and the emotions they stirred through a 3D design.

My goal was to seamlessly fuse modern 3D design techniques with a dash of vintage charm. I must say, the results have exceeded my expectations.
